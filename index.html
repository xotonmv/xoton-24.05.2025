            Hi there! I’m Karl — an artist living in Oslo. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been obsessed with colors, shapes, and the magic of turning emotions into art. Pablo Picasso has always been one of my biggest inspirations. I love how fearless he was with color and how much feeling he packed into every brushstroke.

            When I'm not painting, you’ll usually find me wandering through botanical gardens, soaking up new ideas for my next piece. I share my home (and my studio!) with two cats, Max and Sunshine.

            In my downtime, I’m all about visiting art museums, geeking out over art history, and trying out new techniques with watercolor and acrylics. One of my biggest dreams is to open my own art gallery someday — a place where young, up-and-coming artists can shine.
